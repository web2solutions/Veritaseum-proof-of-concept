# Veritaseum-proof-of-concept

this is just a proof of concept repository.

The main goal is to indentify all bugs and bad implementations on the file id.js.

The final fixed code will reside inside id-fix.js file.


##  Live test for id-fix.js

http://www.web2solutions.com.br/Veritaseum-proof-of-concept/t.html

##  Code test for id-fix.js using Qunit

https://github.com/web2solutions/Veritaseum-proof-of-concept/blob/master/t.html

## example of original implementation using browser console to debug

## example of fixed implementation using browser console to debug

## Proposal

Implement a global array to store resource IDs and avoid multiple object instances of resource with same id
